# Solar System Explorer

An interactive solar system explorer website. Visitors see a zoomed-out view
of the whole solar system, click a planet to fly to it, see POIs on its
surface, and click a POI to read facts.

## Stack
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- React Three Fiber (`@react-three/fiber`) + drei (`@react-three/drei`) on three.js
- Lint: oxlint (`npm run lint`). Type-check and build: `npm run build`

## Project rules
- **Stylized layout, not to scale.** Display radii, orbit distances, and orbit
  speeds are tuned for readability, not astronomical accuracy. Don't "fix"
  them toward real values.
- **All content lives in `src/data/solarSystem.ts`.** Planet names, colors,
  taglines, POIs, and facts belong there. Components read from the data file
  and never hardcode content.
- **Never use Destiny or Bungie assets.** The Destiny 2 "Director" map is only
  a design inspiration. No Destiny or Bungie art, icons, fonts, sounds, names,
  or trademarks. All assets must be original or properly licensed.

## Folder structure
- `src/scene/`: 3D scene components (R3F)
- `src/components/`: 2D UI overlays
- `src/data/`: typed content data

## Git workflow
- Commit after each working feature, with a clear, descriptive message.
- Never commit `node_modules`, build output (`dist`), or secrets (`.env*`).
- Ask before any force push or history rewrite (`push --force`, `rebase`,
  `reset --hard` on shared commits, `commit --amend` on pushed commits).
- This repo is rooted at the project folder. There is an unrelated stray git
  repo at the user's home directory. Never touch it.
